Description: Feature hashing, also called as the hashing trick, is a method to 
  transform features to vector. Without looking the indices up in an 
  associative array, it applies a hash function to the features and uses their 
  hash values as indices directly. 
    This package implements the method of feature hashing proposed in
  Weinberger et. al. (2009) with Murmurhash3 and provides a formula interface
  in R. See the README.md for more information.
