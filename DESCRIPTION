Description: Feature hashing, also called as the hashing trick, is a method to transform 
  features of a instance to a vector. Thus, it is a method to transform a real dataset to a matrix. 
  Without looking up the indices in an associative array, 
  it applies a hash function to the features and uses their hash values as indices directly.
  The method of feature hashing in this package was proposed in Weinberger et al. (2009). 
  The hashing algorithm is the murmurhash3 from the digest package.
